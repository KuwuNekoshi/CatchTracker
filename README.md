# CatchTracker

A simple local web app to track your progress towards a full living Pok√©dex while streaming.

Current data includes Generation I (Red/Blue, Yellow, Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee), Generation II (Gold/Silver, Crystal), and Generation III (Ruby/Sapphire, FireRed/LeafGreen, Emerald) games.

## Quick Start
1. **Install Python 3** (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Download or clone this repository**
3. **Run the app**
   - Windows: double-click `start.py` or run `python start.py`
   - macOS/Linux: `python3 start.py`

The script creates a virtual environment, installs required packages, and launches the tracker.

Progress is saved in `data/state.json`.
